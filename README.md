# Cristiano-Ronaldo-s-Career-Goals-Data-Analysis


This repository contains the code and data for a data analysis of Cristiano Ronaldo's career goals. The data was obtained from Kaggle and includes information on Ronaldo's goals for each club and country he has played for, as well as the type of goal (e.g., penalty, free kick, header).

The analysis explores the following questions:

How many goals has Ronaldo scored in his career?
Which club has he scored the most goals for?
How many wins and loses?
What is his most common type of goal?
Which position he scored the most goals?
How many goals in each season?
What are the type of shots he scored most goals?

The analysis is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn


To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies. Then, run the analysis.py script to generate the plots and tables.

I hope this repository is helpful for your data analysis project.
